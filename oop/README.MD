Like arrays, objects in JavaScript are __containers__. Two primary differences from arrays:

- Arrays contain values, indexed numerically; objects contain properties, indexed by string or symbol.

- Arrays are ordered (arr[0] always comes before arr[1]); objects are not(you can't guarantee obj.a comes before obj.b)

basic vocabulary of OOP.
- A __class__ refers to a generic thing(a car)

- An __instance__ (or __object instance__) refers to a specific thing (a _specific_ car, such as "My Car").

- A piece of functionality(accelerate) is called a _method_.
