<h2>Arrays</h2>

These are **Ordered Lists**

```javascript
let names = ["Michael", "Tony", "Andrea"];
```

**When to use Arrays**

- When you need order
- When you need fast access/insertion and removal

Insertion - depends on where insertion takes place.

```javascript
push(),pop() = O(1)(constant time) (adding or removing data to the end of the array)
unshift(),shift() = O(N)(linear time) (re-indexes every element in the array) 
```

Removal - depends

Searching - O(N)
Access - O(1)
